            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.</p>
            
            <p>Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
            
            <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>

            <h2>Key Features of Python</h2>
            
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Easy to Learn and Use</h3>
                <p>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. It has a relatively small number of keywords, and its structure is straightforward. This makes Python an excellent language for beginners.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Expressive Language</h3>
                <p>Python can accomplish complex tasks with just a few lines of code. For example, a simple "Hello, World!" program is just <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Interpreted Language</h3>
                <p>Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You don't need to compile your program before executing it, which makes debugging easy and development fast.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Cross-platform Language</h3>
                <p>Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh. This makes Python a cross-platform and portable language.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Large Standard Library</h3>
                <p>Python comes with a large standard library that you can use so you don't have to write your own code for every single thing. There are libraries for regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, web browsers, threading, databases, and more.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Supports Multiple Programming Paradigms</h3>
                <p>Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles. You can choose the paradigm that best suits your problem.</p>
